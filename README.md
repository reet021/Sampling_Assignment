# Sampling Assignment

This project demonstrates the impact of different sampling techniques on imbalanced credit card fraud dataset.

## Sampling Techniques
1. Random Undersampling
2. Random Oversampling
3. SMOTE
4. Tomek Links
5. SMOTE + Tomek

## ML Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- KNN
- SVM

## Conclusion
Different models respond differently to sampling. SMOTE and SMOTE+Tomek generally provide better performance.
